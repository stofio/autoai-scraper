    [title] => Recensione di 'Wonka': Timothée Chalamet fa un Willy Wonka vincente in un divertente prequel che è uno dei musical cinematografici più classici degli ultimi decenni
    [excerpt] => Ogni fan di 'Willy Wonka e la fabbrica di cioccolato' (1971) ama la scena in cui Gene Wilder, nel ruolo del mistico produttore di dolciumi, porta i suoi ospiti in un viaggio psichedelico nella galleria sotterranea della fabbrica di cioccolato mentre intona un piccolo verso ('Non c'è modo terreno di sapere, in quale direzione stiamo andando...'), diventando sempre più arrabbiato e isterico. Il Wonka di Wilder era un tipo dolce, ma aveva un lato maniacale nascosto. E in 'Wonka', il divertente, coinvolgente, impeccabilmente messo in scena, incredibilmente tradizionale prequel musicale del leggendario racconto di Roald Dahl, Timothée Chalamet interpreta il personaggio principale come l'anima beata della bontà effervescente.
    [content] => <body><p>Ogni fan de "Willy Wonka e la fabbrica di cioccolato" (1971) adora la scena in cui Gene Wilder, nel ruolo del magico fabbricante di dolciumi, porta i suoi ospiti in un viaggio psichedelico attraverso i meandri della fabbrica di cioccolato mentre recita una piccola poesia ("Non c'è modo terreno di sapere, in quale direzione stiamo andando..."), diventando sempre più arrabbiato e isterico. Willy Wonka di Wilder era un tesoro, ma aveva un lato maniacale nascosto. E in "Charlie e la fabbrica di cioccolato", il magnifico remake del 2005 diretto da Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, all'apice della sua fama cinematografica, ha interpretato Wonka in stile Depp, come una sorta di vampirico incrocio tra Anna Wintour e Michael Jackson.

Ma in "Wonka", il divertente, coinvolgente, impeccabilmente messo in scena e stupefacente musical prequel della leggendaria storia di Roald Dahl, Timothée Chalamet interpreta il personaggio del titolo come l'anima raggiante e spumeggiante del bene. La sua passione per il cioccolato è lì (è quasi definito da essa), ma i difetti sono scomparsi; così come ogni traccia di lato oscuro. Willy, un giovane di circa 25 anni, arriva a Londra dopo sette anni di navigazione intorno al globo, durante i quali ha perlustrato terre oscure alla ricerca delle raffinatezze rare che conferiranno ai suoi dolci un gusto trascendente. Ha le sue ricette per dolcetti come lhoverchoc, un uovo di cioccolato con un insetto all'interno che ti fa levitare, e ha il suo aspetto (lungo cappotto viola, panciotto, cravatta, cilindro scompigliato). Ma soprattutto ha il suo sogno: sollevare il mondo portando la meraviglia dei suoi dolci a tutti.

Per Willy, il cioccolato non è solo una dolcezza. È una religione, qualcosa che ti eleverà e cambierà la tua giornata, il tuo umore, la tua vita. E quella convinzione si incarnata nell'interpretazione delirantemente contagiosa di Chalamet. È difficile interpretare qualcuno così brillante e innocente e desideroso e renderlo magneticamente delizioso, ma Chalamet ha il carisma per farlo. Nel ruolo di Willy, è l'anima di una dolcezza fanciullesca, anche se con un pizzico di tristezza (sente la mancanza di sua madre, interpretata in flashback da Sally Hawkins, che gli ha insegnato l'amore per la cioccolateria), che si esprime nell'aspetto pensieroso e con sopracciglia scure che ci fa capire cosa sta pensando. È come P.T. Barnum interpretato dal figlio di Daniel Day-Lewis. Chalamet canta in un puro baritono sincero, impegnandosi in versi come "Metti la mano nella tasca, prenditi un po' di cioccolato Wonka!" E non è solo il personaggio ad essere sano fino alla nausea. Come film, "Wonka" potrebbe essere il musical hollywoodiano su larga scala più tradizionale degli ultimi decenni.

Quanto è tradizionale? In un'epoca che ci ha regalato musical innovativi e visionari come "La La Land", "Moulin Rouge!" e il sorprendentemente sottovalutato "The Greatest Showman", così come adattamenti di successo di Broadway come "Chicago", "Hairspray", "In the Heights", "Mamma Mia!", "Les Misérables" e "Rent", "Wonka", diretto e co-scritto da Paul King (regista dei film di "Paddington"), sembra una versione più agile e visivamente accattivante di un vecchio musical di canto e danza dei tempi del sistema-studio come "Oliver!" (1968) e "Scrooge" (1970). È così tradizionale che fa sembrare "Il Ritorno di Mary Poppins" moderno.

Willy è venuto a Londra per aprire il suo primo negozio di cioccolato, che ha intenzione di fare nelle Gallerie Gourmet, un vasto centro commerciale sontuoso che ospita i negozi dei tre cioccolatieri regnanti e corrotti della città: Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), il leader del gruppo con un sorriso a serpente; il snob Fickelgruber (Matthew Baynton), che vomita letteralmente ogni volta che sente la parola "povero"; e il pomposo Prodnose (Matt Lucas). Willy ha solo 12 sovrani d'argento, che spende in un solo giorno. Sa che non appena la gente assaggerà il suo cioccolato, avrà i soldi per aprire il negozio dei suoi sogni. Ma quando i nostri tre villain lo assaggiano, sanno di doverlo fermare usando il Capo della Polizia (Keegan-Michael Key), un cioccolatofilo imbranato che obbedisce a loro in cambio di una ricompensa sotterranea di dolciumi.

Come se questa sindacato del cioccolato non fosse già un ostacolo sufficiente, Willy si ritrova ospite nella pensione della signora Scrubbit (Olivia Colman), un'orrida donna dickensiana di Londra che intrappola i suoi ospiti con un contratto a vita, imprigionandoli nel seminterrato come lavoratori schiavizzati. Colman e Tom Davis, nel ruolo dell'accompagnatore imponente della signora Scrubbit (che diventa il suo ridicolo fidanzato con kimono di seta), esagerano e ringhiano come se fossero usciti da una produzione di "Sweeney Todd" in ambito suburbano. Forse bisogna tornare al Catturabambini in "Il Califfato Automobilistico" (1968) per trovare cattivi musicali di questo livello di caricaturale cattiveria.

Willy, a dire il vero, riesce a sfuggire alla prigionia nascondendosi in un carrello della biancheria. Organizza gli altri "prigionieri" di Scrubbit, come l'orfana malinconica Noodle (Calah Lane) e il contabile dallo sguardo severo Abacus (Jim Carter), in una squadra per aiutarlo a sconfiggere le forze del vecchio cinema zoppo. Affronta anche un ladro che diventa un jolly nella sua squadra: un Oompa-Loompa dalla pelle arancione e capelli verdi interpretato da Hugh Grant con un irresistibile tono aristocratico e torvo. Tutto ciò è decisamente piacevole, così come l'aspetto vittoriano sfarzoso del film, e "Wonka", se va bene, diventerà il successo natalizio che i proprietari dei cinema desiderano disperatamente.

Tuttavia, scommetto che sarebbe stato un successo ancora più grande se fosse stato un po' meno liscio per i bambini e se avesse valorizzato maggiormente l'essenza roaldahliana (che era presente nell'adattamento vivace dello scorso anno di "Matilde" di Dahl). Le canzoni del film, scritte da Neil Hannon, ti accompagnano, anche se con più energia che estasi - almeno fino a quando non arrivi alla famosa canzone ripresa da "Willy Wonka e la fabbrica di cioccolato", "Pure Imagination", che fa un bel lavoro nel solleticare il nostro dente dolce della nostalgia. "Wonka" ti fa sentire bene, ma non ti fa mai levitare.</p></body>

    [title] => Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy's Movies Boosted Each Other in a Unique Global Phenomenon
    [excerpt] => Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy have shared an experience, one unique in film history. On July 21, 2023, their two movies came out, and instead of cannibalizing one another during a time when box office receipts were sluggish, they actually boosted each other, creating the global phenomenon known as "Barbenheimer".
    [content] => <body><p>Margot Robbie and Cillian Murphy, the stars of "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" respectively, shared a unique experience in film history. Both of their movies were released on July 21, 2023, and instead of competing with each other at the box office, they actually supported and boosted each other, resulting in a global phenomenon known as "Barbenheimer."

Although "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" are very different films on paper, they have a common thread. Both movies were guided by the inventiveness and originality of their directors, Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan, which inspired audiences to engage creatively and become avid fans of both films. Fans created memes, shared double-feature TikToks, and even dressed up in costumes to watch the films repeatedly in theaters.

"Barbie" has achieved immense success, grossing over $1.4 billion worldwide, while "Oppenheimer" crossed the $950 million mark at the box office. These numbers demonstrate that audiences were eagerly anticipating these films and found joy in experiencing them, especially after the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Margot Robbie, wearing a pink polka-dot shirt and matching heels inspired by "Barbie," and Cillian Murphy, dressed in dark attire, sat down for an interview as part of Actors on Actors. They discussed their respective movies and the unexpected success they achieved together. Murphy admitted that he now knows what a meme is, a topic he famously claimed ignorance about in a previous interview.

Robbie, who also produced "Barbie," was confident in the film's potential for success. She attributed much of it to Greta Gerwig's involvement, emphasizing that choosing Gerwig as the director was crucial to the film's positive reception. The process of bringing "Barbie" to life took six years, from acquiring the rights to producing it alongside Warner Bros. Robbie expressed her gratitude for the cultural phenomenon the film became, surpassing her expectations.

Murphy, on the other hand, had reservations about the reception of a movie about the making of the atomic bomb. However, Christopher Nolan was determined to release it as a summer blockbuster and had a superstition about the 21st of July. Both "Oppenheimer" and "Barbie" ended up sharing the same release date, which Robbie and Murphy found amusing. Despite some initial concerns, Murphy acknowledged that the film's success was beyond what anyone could have predicted.

The two actors also discussed their collaborations with Nolan and Gerwig. Murphy revealed that "Oppenheimer" marked his sixth film with Christopher Nolan and praised his focus and dedication to the work. Robbie expressed her admiration for Gerwig and described the unique challenge of portraying a character like Barbie, who is an iconic figure but not based on a real person.

They delved into the preparation process for their roles. Murphy mentioned the extensive research he did, including studying pictures of J. Robert Oppenheimer and receiving inspiration from Chris Nolan's references to David Bowie. Robbie, on the other hand, found it challenging to prepare for a character like Barbie, as her usual acting tools didn't apply. However, with Gerwig's guidance, she discovered a new approach to the character and found inspiration from an episode of "This American Life."

The discussion continued with a focus on the costumes for "Barbie." Robbie highlighted the importance of the color pink, which is synonymous with the iconic doll. They also reminisced about the spirited atmosphere on set, with Robbie implementing a "On Wednesdays, we wear pink" tradition, inspired</p><html><body><img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Margot-Robbie-Cillian-Murphy-Variety-Actors-on-Actors-Cover.jpg?w=791"></body></html><html><body><img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Margot-Robbie-Variety-Actors-on-Actors-Full.jpg?w=819"></body></html><html><body><img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cillian-Murphy-Variety-Actors-on-Actors-Full.jpg?w=819"></body></html><html><body><img src="https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Cillian-Murphy-Margot-Robbie-Variety-Actors-on-Actors-Full.jpg?w=819"></body></html></body>

    [title] => Leaks suggest Nvidia's RTX 4090D will lack overclocking and be TDP-Capped
    [excerpt] => Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090D, designed for the Chinese market, may have reduced specifications such as reduced CUDA cores and base clock speed. The graphics card will also have its overclocking capabilities locked and total graphics power (TGP) capped at 425W. Although the product has not been confirmed by Nvidia, leaked specifications are expected to surface soon.
    [content] => <body><p>Nvidia is reportedly working on a gaming graphics card called the GeForce RTX 4090D specifically designed for the Chinese market. While the product has not been confirmed by Nvidia, recent leaks have provided some insight into its specifications. However, due to the stance of the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding powerful GPUs for China, it is uncertain whether the card will be launched at all. According to leaks from @Zed__Wang and BenchLife.info, the GeForce RTX 4090D is based on the AD102-250 GPU and may have a base clock of 2280 MHz and a possible boost clock of 2520 MHz. These clock speeds suggest that the AD102-250 GPU will have a reduced number of CUDA cores and other units. To prevent the GeForce RTX 4090D from outperforming the regular RTX 4090 when overclocked, the graphics card will have a total graphics power (TGP) capped at 425W and its overclocking capabilities will be locked. Nvidia's add-in-board (AIB) partners are expected to receive samples of the AD102-250 GPU for testing soon, so more specifications will likely be leaked. However, it is important to note that the U.S. Department of Commerce may issue export rules and ban the export of these products to China before their official launch. While it is possible that Nvidia intends to make the GeForce RTX 4090D available in China by reducing its performance, the situation remains uncertain.</p></body>

    [title] => The 23andMe Data Breach: More Severe Than Initially Reported
    [excerpt] => The 23andMe data breach that occurred in October has been confirmed to have affected 6.9 million people, rather than the original estimate of 14,000 users. The stolen information includes users' full names, birth years, relationship labels, and locations. Additionally, hackers were able to access genetic data, including details about DNA percentages and chromosome matching. This breached data is already being sold on the black market, with certain ethnic groups being specifically targeted. Meanwhile, 23andMe has updated its terms of service to prevent users from filing a class-action lawsuit, shifting the blame onto users for reusing passwords. It is vital for niche organizations like 23andMe to prioritize cybersecurity measures in protecting sensitive data.
    [content] => <body><p>The 23andMe data breach that occurred in October has been confirmed to be much worse than initially reported. Instead of the 14,000 users initially believed to be affected, it has now been revealed that 6.9 million people were impacted. The stolen information includes users' full names, birth years, relationship labels, and locations. Additionally, approximately 1.4 million users had their Family Tree profile information compromised. In this breach, hackers were able to access genetic details, such as common DNA percentages shared with relatives and chromosome matching.</p>

<p>Reports suggest that the stolen data has already been put up for sale on the black market, with specific targeting of various ethnic groups. Bad actors are selling individual information for as little as $1 to $10 per data set. Meanwhile, 23andMe has taken steps to cover their tracks by updating their terms of service, which now require users to resolve any legal complaints outside of court. This means that users would be unable to pursue a class-action lawsuit unless they opt out of private resolution. To do so, users must email arbitrationoptout@23andme.com within 30 days of the update.</p>

<p>23andMe has attempted to shift the responsibility onto its users, claiming that the breach occurred due to the reuse of passwords from other accounts. This cyberattack technique, known as credential stuffing, allowed hackers to access the initial 14,000 accounts. From there, they were able to navigate through the company's database to steal additional information.</p>

<p>The full implications of this breach are not yet known, but experts have warned about the potential risks associated with the collection of consumer data online. Even when the data collection is legal, there is the possibility of implicit bias that can affect various aspects of individuals' lives, including employment, housing, credit applications, and insurance premiums. In illegal instances, identity theft can occur. The breach also raises concerns about the misuse of genetic data, specifically in making deductions about individuals' health information and medical family history.</p>

<p>While it is true that some users of 23andMe did not practice strong password hygiene, experts argue that as a niche organization dealing with such sensitive data, the company should prioritize cybersecurity. The hosting of such valuable information makes 23andMe an attractive target for cyberattacks, and implementing additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication, would be advisable.</p>
