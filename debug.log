2023-11-15 12:12:53 <p>Just ahead of the weekend, Asus co-CEO Samson Hu talked about his company&rsquo;s plans to roll out the first AI PCs in 2024. The executive told attendees at the annual technology forum at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan, that AI PCs should carry a price premium over standard PCs. However, Hu was vague about what would differentiate an AI PC &ndash; hardware, software, or possibly a mix of both. Today Asus also released its 2023 Q3 financials, and the investor slide deck suggests it already has big plans for AI PCs over the coming months.We think that two major tech events are going to collide in 2024, and give birth to high-performance AI PCs. Microsoft has already started rolling out Copilot AI features for Windows users, and adding AI to several of its popular applications. Meanwhile, early 2024 should see the first availability of Intel Meteor Lake systems, with a dedicated NPU tile as part of the processor &ndash; accelerating local AI processing. Let us also not forget AMD is expected to release desktop APUs with AI acceleration in January 2024, too.The Asus co-CEO told forum attendees that there are about 300 Windows developers working on AI apps that will benefit from local AI acceleration. This will be another important driver of sales of AI PCs, which are expected to initially be targeted at enterprises and content creators.However, Hu wasn&rsquo;t firm in providing a definition of an AI PC. The first wave of this new class of PCs could feature processors that feature on-board AI acceleration. However, some might offer AI PCs that are simply capable of running Microsoft365 Copilot, for example. Different PC vendors, many of which now have AI PC plans in place, will outline different definitions, reckons Hu. Nevertheless, the Asus co-CEO reckons an AI PC should feature more advanced processor families and bigger memory quotas.Image 1 of 4<span></span>(Image credit: Asus)<span></span>(Image credit: Asus)<span></span>(Image credit: Asus)<span></span>(Image credit: Asus)Asus sees 2024 as a year that sets a foundation for AI PCs, with a mere single-digit percentage market penetration until 2025 or later. Despite these modest expectations, a large slice of today&rsquo;s investor presentation stoked enthusiasm for AI PCs. One slide said Asus was &ldquo;redefining the PC with AI,&rdquo; and another that it was looking forward to &ldquo;rapid technological advancements in the era of AI PC.&rdquo; Moreover, in its business highlights it confirms it is &ldquo;targeting to introduce the world&rsquo;s first AI PC.&rdquo; Outside of consumer and creator AI PCs, we can also see Asus reckons AIoT, AI Server, and AI HPC are all drivers for continued growth.

2023-11-15 12:14:39 <p>Chinese Mini PC maker AceMagic has revealed its most powerful device to date. The new AceMagic Tank 03 comes packing up to an &nbsp;Intel Core i9-12900H, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080M graphics, 64 GB of DDR5 RAM, and three NVMe storage slots. However, the cube-shaped device, with its unsubtle vents, bold graphics, dazzling RGB, and prominent dial, upset the sensibilities of some of the gentler folk in the Tom&rsquo;s Hardware office.According to Liliputing, AceMagic says its Tank 03 Mini PC design is inspired by sci-fi spaceships, rather than, say, air fryers, rice cookers, bread ovens, or budget 1990s hi-fi. So any resemblance to those devices must be purely coincidental.<img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6saZ9MFL9wYzZTVBZnXh44.jpg">(Image credit: AceMagic)If the AceMagic Tank 03 were a spaceship, it would require a crew of nano-aliens, as the chassis measures just 167 x 167 x 161mm (6.6 x 6.6 x 6.3 inches). Despite its diminutive stature, this box can be configured with some quite potent last-gen (mobile) processors. As noted in the intro, potential buyers will be tempted with components such as an Intel Core i9-12900H and Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080M. Having seen AceMagic products before, we think one of the greatest attractions of the Tank 03 is going to be its price.The Tank 03 may be compact (for a desktop) but its boxy dimensions should allow for cooling solutions of greater stature than any laptop. AceMagic thus includes a substantial CPU cooler with a fan, two D8 heatpipes in an O-shaped layout, and an airflow path in from the bottom, then out of the back. The GPU is cooled by five D5 heatpipes, multiple fans, and air coming from the case's top vent, then exhausted out of a separate area at the back. Users can change between Silent, Auto, and Performance modes, and cooling profiles can be switched using the large protruding RGB-infused front dial.Swipe to scroll horizontallyAceMagic Tank 03CPUIntel Core i7-12700H or Core i9-12900HGPUNvidia GeForce RTX 3060M (80W), RTX 3070M (120W), or RTX 3080MRAMUp to 64 GB DDR5-4800 via dual SO-DIMM slotsStorage1 x M.2 2280 (PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe SSD), 2 x M.2 PCIe x2 NVMe/SATAConnectivity1 x Thunderbolt 4, 6 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, 2 x HDMI 2.0, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 2 x 3.5mm audio (1 front, 1 rear), 2 x 2.5 GBE Ethernet, 1 x SD card reader, Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2OtherRGB lighting, tri-level power dialOSWindows 11 Pro<img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DAKqbqMj98uB2aGkk3rKA4.jpg">(Image credit: AceMagic)Some GeForce RTX 3080M laptops had 8 GB of VRAM, others 16 GB, so we hope that AceMagic offers the latter on its flagship Tank 03 Mini PC gaming system.The AceMagic Tank 03 Mini PC isn&rsquo;t listed on the maker&rsquo;s web pages at the time of writing. Moreover, Liliputing says that it has had no word regarding pricing or availability dates as yet. It does expect four pre-configured systems to be put up for offer in due course, though. These vary from an Intel Core i7-12700H model with GeForce RTX 3060M, 16 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB SSD, all the way up to the Core i9-12900H and GeForce RTX 3080M model with 32 GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD pre-installed. All models come with Windows 11 Pro.
