2023-11-17 23:48:25 <p>Political instability has become a burden to both local and international companies &mdash; something we&rsquo;ve seen in the trade war between the US and China. Add to that the always-present risk of emergent armed conflict between nation states and other actors, as well as central government&rsquo;s tendency to legislate in broad strokes, and you can see why companies might be interested in being able to skip most of those drawbacks of modern society. What if companies were instead able to set up shop in uncontested land, away from prying eyes and legislative blowouts? To create their own circular economies, to legislate within their own facilities, to answer only to logistics and globalization requirements?This is the aim of Del Complex &mdash; or, at least, it seems to be its aim. It&rsquo;s currently hard to say whether it&rsquo;s an actual company or a concept that&rsquo;s just asking for some venture funding &mdash; but theirs is a relatively old idea of a &ldquo;company town&rdquo; modernized with the right keywords of AI, Nvidia GPU clusters, and sovereignty, and it still turns heads.Did we mention the tax benefits of owning your own, literally off-shore fiscal paradise? Del Complex does, as they put it on their website, &ldquo;Free from regulatory oversight, the BlueSea Frontier Compute Clusters offer unparalleled opportunities to train and deploy the next generation of large scale AI models.&rdquo;In an age where the discussion is largely around how to effectively regulate AI technologies in order to mitigate their negative impacts, there&rsquo;s a call toward full deregulation.Further citing the need to escape from &ldquo;hastily drafted government regulation&rdquo; in the context of the emergence of AI systems, Del Complex airs the idea of self-contained units of industry &mdash; a product they&rsquo;ve named the BlueSea Frontier Compute Cluster (BSFCC): barge-like platforms that can be turned into semi-permanent installations deep within international waters. The main idea is this: load a barge with everything needed to run your own 10,000- GPU AI research compute cluster alongside a permanent population, and launch it far enough into the ocean that it reaches the no-man's land of international waters. And to thwart any potentially aggressive disagreements with your idea or the direction you're floating the barge in, Del Complex also proposes maintaining a private security force on-premises to counter &ldquo;kinetic threats&rdquo;.That these BSFCC platforms are anchored in no man&rsquo;s land means they effectively circumvent national regulations on everything.
