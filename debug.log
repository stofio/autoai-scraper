		Nothing’s iMessage for Android app is unbelievably bad	
    [content] => <p>Andy Boxall / Digital TrendsEarlier this week, Nothing did the unexpected and launched the &ldquo;Nothing Chats&rdquo; app for the Nothing Phone 2. The premise? Let anyone with a Nothing Phone 2 send and receive texts via iMessage. Nothing partnered with Sunbird to make Nothing Chats work, with Nothing essentially using Sunbird&rsquo;s own messaging tech to bring iMessage to Android.ContentsThe problem with Nothing ChatsWhere does Nothing go from here?It was a bold idea &hellip; but one that was short-lived. That&rsquo;s because Nothing Chats is already dead (for the time being) due to a shocking number of security vulnerabilities that were discovered almost immediately. And by security vulnerabilities, we don&rsquo;t mean minor oversights that could have been easy to overlook. We&rsquo;re talking about major, game-breaking design flaws that massively compromise the personal information of anyone who used Nothing Chats.

Per 9to5&rsquo;s own findings:&ldquo;In our Dylan Roussel&rsquo;s research, we found that once a user authenticates with the JSON Web Tokens (JWT) that are insecure in transit, they can access Nothing Chat&rsquo;s Firebase database and see messages and files from other users sent in real-time and in plain text.&rdquo;<img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nothing-chats-imessage.jpg?fit=720%2C480&amp;p=1">Andy Boxall / Digital TrendsThe report goes on to mention how vCards (aka contact cards) were also fully accessible &mdash; including people&rsquo;s names, numbers, email addresses, and other personally identifiable information.

However, Nothing still decided to partner with Sunbird to create and launch Nothing Chats, and the fact that the company never discovered these vulnerabilities while creating Nothing Chats is troubling.If you still have the Nothing Chats app on your phone, we strongly advise you to stop using it immediately. That same recommendation applies if you&rsquo;re using the regular Sunbird app as well. Having iMessage on an Android phone is a fun convenience, but not at the risk of your personal information being so heavily compromised. You&rsquo;re better off just waiting for Apple to add RCS to the iPhone in 2024.As for the future of Nothing Chats, it&rsquo;s difficult to say what will happen next. Nothing says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;delaying&rdquo; the launch, but to fix all of the issues we just talked about here, Sunbird would have to dramatically overhaul its entire backend process. Is Nothing going to want to wait for that to happen, or will it decide to just cut its losses and pull the plug on Nothing Chats for good? At this point, it seems like the latter may be the better choice.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">

    [title] => Nothing’s iMessage for Android app faces major security vulnerabilities
    [excerpt] => Nothing Chats, the iMessage for Android app launched by Nothing, has been discovered to have major security vulnerabilities that compromise personal information. The app has been pulled from the Play Store and the launch has been delayed as the company works with Sunbird to fix the bugs.
    [content] => <p>The Nothing Chats app for the Nothing Phone 2 launched earlier this week, allowing users to send and receive texts via iMessage. The app was developed in partnership with Sunbird, using their messaging technology to bring iMessage to Android.</p>

<p>However, the launch of Nothing Chats was short-lived due to the discovery of numerous security vulnerabilities. These flaws posed significant risks to the personal information of users, making the app highly insecure.</p>

<p>The first report of security concerns came from Kishan Bagaria, the founder of Texts.com. Bagaria found that messages sent via Nothing Chats were not using HTTPS security credentials, but rather the less secure HTTP standard in plain text. This meant that anyone with access to the messages could easily read them.</p>

<p>Another user, Wukko, confirmed these vulnerabilities and discovered that all messaging data sent and stored in the app was unencrypted and accessible through a Firebase platform. Additionally, more than 630,000 media files were found to be publicly accessible on Sunbird's Firebase server.</p>

<p>These security issues were not minor oversights. They compromised the privacy and security of users, as messages, media attachments, and even contact cards were accessible to unauthorized individuals.</p>

<p>Following these reports, Nothing made the decision to remove the Nothing Chats app from the Play Store and delay its launch until further notice. The company acknowledged the bugs and committed to working with Sunbird to address them.</p>

<p>While Sunbird is primarily responsible for fixing these security flaws, the fact that Nothing partnered with them without discovering these vulnerabilities during development is concerning.</p>

<p>Users are strongly encouraged to stop using the Nothing Chats app and the regular Sunbird app immediately to protect their personal information. It may be more prudent to wait for Apple to introduce RCS, a next-generation messaging protocol, to the iPhone in 2024.</p>

<p>As for the future of Nothing Chats, it remains uncertain. The extensive overhaul required to address the identified issues raises questions about whether Nothing will choose to continue investing in the app or pull the plug.</p>

		CPU owners are suing Intel. Here’s the surprising reason why	
    [content] => <p>IntelFive unhappy owners of Intel CPUs have just started a class action lawsuit against the company following the discovery that, allegedly, Intel knowingly sold processors affected by a dangerous vulnerability &mdash; and it has been doing this for years. The flaw in question is called Downfall, and while it doesn&rsquo;t affect Intel&rsquo;s best CPUs, it&rsquo;s present in chips ranging from the 6th to the 11th generation of Intel processors.Dating back to Skylake CPUs and still present in Rocket Lake chips, the Downfall vulnerability was first made public by security researcher Daniel Moghimi. This flaw targets the Gather Instruction process in Intel CPUs. Normally, this allows the CPU to quickly access various data in its memory, but unfortunately, this also means that any vulnerabilities within Gather Instruction grant the threat actor a lot of access to the affected PC. Be it through malware or by direct access, attackers could potentially steal a lot of sensitive data from affected chips.
			Recommended Videos		Intel issued a patch to prevent the bug, but it came at a huge cost. As reported by Tom&rsquo;s Hardware, downloading the patch slowed down AVX2 and AVX-512 workloads by up to 50%. This left users stuck in a lose-lose situation where they could either make themselves vulnerable to Downfall or patch the CPU and suffer from the performance loss. The plaintiffs disagree with this approach from Intel and are now demanding a jury trial at the U.S. District Court in San Jose.

					I got a rare peek into Intel&rsquo;s largest offshore manufacturing facility &mdash; here&rsquo;s what I learned				First reported on by The Register, the class action suit has five plaintiffs who own one of the chips that are affected by Downfall. According to the suit, Intel was made aware of the vulnerability all the way back in 2018, when Intel was already dealing with other threats, namely Spectre and Meltdown. Third-party researchers prepared vulnerability reports about the yet-unnamed downfall back then, finding a flaw within the AVX instruction set in a similar manner to Spectre and Meltdown.Alexander Yee, a hardware enthusiast, prepared a write-up about the flaw in 2018 and delayed publishing it until August 7, 2018, reportedly at Intel&rsquo;s request. Due to this, the plaintiffs believe that Intel should have addressed Downfall in 2018 when it was first informed about the flaw instead of proceeding to sell the chips as-is.<img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/intel-iaa-mobility-keynote-final-2.jpg?fit=720%2C720&amp;p=1">Intel&ldquo;Despite promising a hardware redesign to mitigate speculative execution vulnerabilities during the exact time period researchers disclosed the vulnerabilities in Intel&rsquo;s AVX instructions, Intel did nothing. It did not fix its then-current chips, and over three successive generations, Intel did not redesign its chips to ensure that AVX instructions would operate securely when the CPU speculatively executed them,&rdquo; says the complaint.The document also talks about the five affected plaintiffs, with one person in particular saying that she &ldquo;would not have purchased her Intel CPUs at the price she paid had she known about the defect described in this Complaint.&rdquo;The complaint also outlines what the plaintiffs are after: &ldquo;Intel&rsquo;s affected CPUs &mdash; billions of them &mdash; are to this day defectively designed, and Intel has instituted no recall, implemented no repair program, and provided no plan to fix the underlying design defect. Plaintiffs seek damages and equitable relief.&rdquo;Intel has declined to comment on these allegations thus far. It&rsquo;s hard to say where this can go, and with these CPUs being a few generations old by now, they&rsquo;re hard to find in stores at this point. However, those who already own them still face a difficult choice: To update or not to update? Intel itself recommends updating, but if you often use your CPU to run AVX2 and AVX-512 workloads, you might experience severe drops in performance.<h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">

    [title] => Intel faces class action lawsuit over sale of CPUs with dangerous vulnerability
    [excerpt] => A class action lawsuit has been filed against Intel by five CPU owners who claim that the company knowingly sold processors affected by a dangerous vulnerability called Downfall. The vulnerability, present in Intel processors ranging from the 6th to the 11th generation, allows threat actors to potentially steal sensitive data from affected chips. Intel issued a patch to fix the flaw but it resulted in a significant performance loss for users. The plaintiffs are demanding a jury trial and seek damages and equitable relief.
    [content] => Five dissatisfied owners of Intel CPUs have recently filed a class action lawsuit against the company. The lawsuit alleges that Intel knowingly sold processors with a dangerous vulnerability known as Downfall for several years. Although this flaw does not affect Intel's top CPUs, it is present in chips ranging from the 6th to the 11th generation of Intel processors.

The Downfall vulnerability, which was first disclosed by security researcher Daniel Moghimi, targets the Gather Instruction process in Intel CPUs. While this feature allows the CPU to quickly access various data in its memory, it also exposes the affected PC to potential attacks. Threat actors can exploit this vulnerability to steal sensitive data from the affected chips, either through malware or direct access.

Intel has released a patch to address the Downfall vulnerability; however, this fix comes at a significant cost. According to reports, downloading the patch can slow down AVX2 and AVX-512 workloads by up to 50%. This puts users in a difficult position where they have to choose between remaining vulnerable to Downfall or patching the CPU and experiencing performance degradation.

The plaintiffs in the class action lawsuit disagree with Intel's approach and are demanding a jury trial at the U.S. District Court in San Jose. The lawsuit involves five individuals who own CPUs affected by the Downfall vulnerability. They claim that Intel was aware of the vulnerability as early as 2018 when the company was already dealing with other security threats like Spectre and Meltdown.

Third-party researchers had prepared vulnerability reports about Downfall back in 2018, noting a flaw within the AVX instruction set similar to Spectre and Meltdown. It is alleged that one hardware enthusiast, Alexander Yee, had already prepared a write-up about the flaw in the same year but delayed publishing it at Intel's request. The plaintiffs argue that Intel should have addressed Downfall in 2018 instead of continuing to sell the chips with the known vulnerability.

The complaint filed against Intel states, "Despite promising a hardware redesign to mitigate speculative execution vulnerabilities during the exact time period researchers disclosed the vulnerabilities in Intel's AVX instructions, Intel did nothing. It did not fix its then-current chips, and over three successive generations, Intel did not redesign its chips to ensure that AVX instructions would operate securely when the CPU speculatively executed them."

The complaint also highlights the five affected plaintiffs, with one individual stating that she would not have purchased her Intel CPU at the price she paid if she had known about the defect described in the complaint. The plaintiffs are seeking damages and equitable relief for Intel's allegedly defective design of the affected CPUs.

Intel has not yet responded to these allegations. While it is unclear how this legal action will unfold, it is worth noting that these CPUs are now a few generations old and may be difficult to find in stores. However, existing owners of these CPUs face a challenging decision of whether to update their systems or not. Although Intel recommends updating, users who heavily rely on AVX2 and AVX-512 workloads may experience significant performance drops.

In conclusion, this class action lawsuit raises serious allegations against Intel regarding the sale of CPUs affected by the Downfall vulnerability and the company's response to addressing the issue. The outcome of the legal proceedings will determine if Intel is held accountable for the alleged design defect and if the affected plaintiffs will receive the damages they seek.

    [title] => Nothing’s iMessage for Android app is dangerously insecure
    [excerpt] => Nothing recently launched their Nothing Chats app for the Nothing Phone 2, allowing users to send and receive texts via iMessage. However, the app was quickly found to have major security vulnerabilities, compromising the personal information of its users. As a result, Nothing has temporarily removed the app from the Play Store to address the issues. It remains uncertain what the future holds for Nothing Chats.
    [content] => <p>Earlier this week, Nothing surprised everyone by launching an app called "Nothing Chats" for the Nothing Phone 2. The purpose of the app was to allow users of the Nothing Phone 2 to send and receive text messages through iMessage. To make this possible, Nothing partnered with Sunbird, which provided the messaging technology to enable iMessage on Android devices.</p>

<p>While the idea of Nothing Chats was bold and innovative, it was short-lived due to the discovery of numerous security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were not minor oversights but major design flaws that compromised the personal information of anyone using the app.</p>

<p>One of the first concerns raised about Nothing Chats was regarding its lack of HTTPS security credentials for messages. Instead, the app was using the less secure HTTP standard, transmitting messages in plain text. This vulnerability was discovered by Kishan Bagaria, the founder of Texts.com, and their team. The messages sent via Nothing Chats were clearly visible to anyone with the knowledge and tools to intercept them.</p>

<p>Another security concern was the lack of encryption for messaging data. Wukko on X confirmed that all messaging data sent and stored by Nothing Chats was done without encryption and was easily accessible via Sunbird's Firebase platform.</p>

<p>Furthermore, 9to5Google discovered that users could access the Firebase database of Nothing Chats and view messages and files from other users in real-time and in plain text. Contact cards (vCards) containing personal information such as names, numbers, and email addresses were also fully accessible. Additionally, more than 630,000 media files stored in Sunbird's Firebase server were discovered by 9to5Google, adding to the privacy concerns.</p>

<p>In response to these serious security vulnerabilities, Nothing promptly removed the Nothing Chats app from the Play Store and announced a delay in the launch to address the bugs. However, the damage caused by the vulnerabilities may have already impacted users who had installed the app.</p>

<p>The responsibility for these security issues lies with Sunbird, as it is the provider of the backend for Nothing Chats. Nothing's decision to partner with Sunbird raises concerns about the oversight and due diligence involved in the development of the app.</p>

<p>For users who still have the Nothing Chats app or the regular Sunbird app installed, it is strongly advised to stop using them immediately. The convenience of having iMessage on an Android device is not worth the risk of compromising personal information. It may be more prudent to wait for Apple to introduce RCS (Rich Communication Services) to iPhones in 2024.</p>

<p>The future of Nothing Chats is uncertain. While Nothing has announced a delay in the launch and plans to work with Sunbird to fix the issues, completely overhauling the backend process would be a significant undertaking. It remains to be seen whether Nothing will wait for these fixes or decide to discontinue Nothing Chats entirely.</p>

That&rsquo;s because Nothing Chats is already dead (for the time being) due to a shocking number of security vulnerabilities that were discovered almost immediately. And by security vulnerabilities, we don&rsquo;t mean minor oversights that could have been easy to overlook. We&rsquo;re talking about major, game-breaking design flaws that massively compromise the personal information of anyone who used Nothing Chats.

However, Nothing still decided to partner with Sunbird to create and launch Nothing Chats, and the fact that the company never discovered these vulnerabilities while creating Nothing Chats is troubling.If you still have the Nothing Chats app on your phone, we strongly advise you to stop using it immediately. That same recommendation applies if you&rsquo;re using the regular Sunbird app as well. Having iMessage on an Android phone is a fun convenience, but not at the risk of your personal information being so heavily compromised. You&rsquo;re better off just waiting for Apple to add RCS to the iPhone in 2024.As for the future of Nothing Chats, it&rsquo;s difficult to say what will happen next. Nothing says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;delaying&rdquo; the launch, but to fix all of the issues we just talked about here, Sunbird would have to dramatically overhaul its entire backend process. Is Nothing going to want to wait for that to happen, or will it decide to just cut its losses and pull the plug on Nothing Chats for good? At this point, it seems like the latter may be the better choice.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">

    [title] => Nothing’s iMessage for Android app is dangerously insecure
    [excerpt] => Nothing recently launched the “Nothing Chats” app for the Nothing Phone 2, which allows users to send and receive texts via iMessage. However, the app has been plagued with major security vulnerabilities that compromise the personal information of users. Messages sent via Nothing Chats were not using HTTPS security credentials and were easily accessible in plain text. Furthermore, all messaging data and attachments were unencrypted and stored on an easily accessible platform. Due to these issues, the app has been removed from the Play Store, and the future of Nothing Chats is uncertain.
    [content] => <p>Earlier this week, Nothing made a surprising move by launching the "Nothing Chats" app for the Nothing Phone 2. The app aimed to allow users with a Nothing Phone 2 to send and receive texts via iMessage. Nothing partnered with Sunbird to make this possible, leveraging Sunbird's messaging technology to bring iMessage to Android.</p>

<p>However, this bold idea turned out to be short-lived. Almost immediately after its launch, Nothing Chats faced a shocking number of security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities were not minor oversights, but major design flaws that posed serious risks to the personal information of its users.</p>

<p>The first report of security concerns came from Kishan Bagaria, the founder of Texts.com. Bagaria and their team discovered that messages sent via Nothing Chats were not transmitted using HTTPS security credentials. Instead, the messages were sent using the less secure HTTP standard in plain text. Another user, Wukko on X, confirmed this finding and noted that all messages, including standard texts, images, and other media attachments, were visible to anyone who knew where to look.</p>

<p>Further investigation revealed that all messaging data sent and stored in Nothing Chats was done so without encryption and through an easily accessible Firebase platform. 9to5Google reported that users could access the Firebase database and view the messages and files of other users, including vCards with personal contact information. Additionally, over 630,000 media files were found to be stored in Sunbird's Firebase server.</p>

<p>To summarize, the security issues with Nothing Chats are severe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Messages are not end-to-end encrypted</li>
  <li>Messages are sent in plain text</li>
  <li>Media and other attachments are publicly accessible</li>
  <li>Sunbird has access to messages and attachments</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the gravity of these security vulnerabilities, Nothing made the right decision to remove the Nothing Chats app from the Play Store and delay its launch indefinitely. However, the damage may already have been done. While the responsibility for these issues lies with Sunbird, Nothing chose to partner with them for the creation and launch of Nothing Chats. The fact that these vulnerabilities were not discovered during development raises concerns.</p>

<p>If you have the Nothing Chats app or the regular Sunbird app installed on your phone, it is strongly advised to stop using them immediately. While having iMessage on an Android phone may be convenient, it is not worth compromising your personal information. It may be better to wait for Apple's implementation of RCS on the iPhone in 2024.</p>

<p>As for the future of Nothing Chats, it is uncertain. Nothing states that the launch is being delayed to address the issues, but fixing all the identified vulnerabilities would require significant changes to Sunbird's backend process. It remains to be seen if Nothing will wait for these changes or decide to abandon the project altogether. At this point, the latter option seems more reasonable.</p>
